# Summary of what was observed from the results
With the neural network, we observed the importance of
balancing the classes / sensitivity / specificity
dealing with overfitting. The interesting task of tuning the parameters / The influence of the dropout rate on the validation accuracy.
The overall accuracy on the test set that happend to be very good with our final model
the validation accuracy that is higher than the training accuracy

# Implications for the business (link with the context and the initial objectives of the study)

# Limitations (this may be the subject of a separated section). An opening is often expected here: “What next?” “What can be done for improvement”, etc.?
