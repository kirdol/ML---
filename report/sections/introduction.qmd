# Introduction

During our first year as master’s students in Management with a focus on Business Analytics, we had the opportunity to attend lectures on Machine Learning for Business Analytics. This course covered a range of machine learning techniques applicable to business contexts. We explored supervised methods such as regressions, decision trees, support vector machines, and neural networks, as well as unsupervised methods like clustering, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Factor Analysis of Mixed Data (FAMD), and auto-encoders. Additionally, the course addressed essential topics such as data splitting, ensemble methods, and performance metrics.

In the context of this course, our group undertook an applied project aimed at integrating theoretical knowledge with practical application. Starting from scratch, we identified a suitable dataset to apply machine learning techniques learned in class to real-world scenarios. We selected a comprehensive dataset encompassing vehicle metrics such as MPG, range, engine statistics, and more, spanning over 100 different brands.

The primary aim of our research was to develop a predictive model that can identify the make (i.e., the brand) of a vehicle based on its attributes, such as consumption, range, and fuel type. To accomplish this, we utilized advanced machine learning algorithms, specifically classification trees (CT) and neural networks (NN). We acknowledged that some vehicles might share identical characteristics but differ in other aspects, so our goal was to create a robust model capable of accurately predicting a vehicle’s brand from its features. Additionally, we investigated the potential of clustering our models using unsupervised learning techniques. This project not only deepened our understanding of machine learning concepts but also demonstrated their practical applicability in solving real-world problems.

The dataset was sourced from data.world, a platform that hosts a diverse range of open-access datasets. It comprises over 45,000 rows and 26 columns, with each row representing a unique vehicle and its corresponding features. The dataset includes comprehensive information on the vehicle’s make, model, year, fuel type, consumption per barrel, highway miles per gallon (MPG), among other features. It is available in CSV format, which facilitates ease of access and analysis.

Given the nature of our objective, being to predict the make of the vehicle, we chose classification models. 

In the subsequent sections, we will first provide a comprehensive description of our dataset in the `Data Description` section, followed by a detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in the `EDA` section. After an in-depth examination of the data, we will proceed to the data cleaning and preparation phase in the `Data Cleaning` section. Subsequently, we will outline the various methodologies employed in the `Methods` section. Utilizing the cleaned dataset, we will implement our initial model, a classification tree, in the `Classification Tree` section to predict the make of the vehicle. This will be followed by the application of a neural network model in the `Neural Networks` section. We will then transition to unsupervised learning techniques in the `Principal Component Analysis` and `Clustering` sections. Our study will converge in the ?Recommendations and Discussion` section, where we will synthesize our results and explore the implications of our findings. The document will conclude with a `References section`, followed by an `Annex`.
