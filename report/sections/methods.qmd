# Methods

This section provides a detailed explanation of the methods used in this study, aimed at ensuring reproducibility. The global strategy and the specific tools employed are described concisely, with relevant properties highlighted. Clear references are provided for further details where necessary.

## Supervised Learning

### Classification Tree

As our dataset is dealing with classes, we decided to use a Classification Tree to predict the make of the car.

Classification Trees are constituted of one root node and a hierarchical set of binary rules. Each node represents a decision on an attribute, each branch the outcome of the decision and each leaf a class label (The most important features are located at the top of the graph). Thus, the name is coming from the shape of the representation, that looks like a tree. Even if it can also be applied to regressions, we are using it in our case for classification tasks.

Key parameters and hyperparameters used in Classification Tree include (non-exhaustive):

**Parameters**

-   Data observations

-   Method (usually "class", which specifies that the decision tree being constructed is for classification tasks)

**Hyperparameters**

-   **Minsplit** : minimum number of observations that must exist in a node for a split to be attempted

-   **minbucket** : controls the minimum size of terminal nodes

-   **complexity parameter (cp)** : controls the size of the decision tree. Also prevents overfitting.

-   **Maximum depth** : Set a maximum "length" of the tree, starting from the root node.

-   **Random state** : Set a specific number to control the randomness of the estimator.

We had in must of our models to encode categorical variables using Label Encoding to convert them into numerical values. In addition, we had to split the dataset into training (80%) and testing (20%). This step is essential for preventing overfitting, try to select the best model configuration by training the model, then assess the final model performance on our "unseen data" of the testing set. This helps to build a robust model that generalizes well to new data.

### Our models

1.  Classification Tree without Base model

2.  Classification Tree with 10 K-fold CV

3.  Classification Tree with Pruning (Setting a limit for the max depth)

4.  Classification Tree with Re-Sampling

### Classification Tree without constraints

The base model serves as a baseline that will be used to measure the added values of the different techniques that we will apply later.

In our case, the Decision Tree Classifier creates the decision tree. It initializes the process of recursively splitting the dataset into subsets based on the value of the features. It also implicitly defines the loss function, with the two following most common criterias : Gini Impurity (measuring how mixed are the classes in a node, also selecting the best features) and Entropy (different from the Logistic Regression, measure of chaos, indicating the uncertainty reduced by the split).

### 10 K-fold CV

K-Fold cross-validation is a method to assess the performance of a model. It has the following steps :

-   Divide the Data: The dataset is split into k equally sized subsets or "folds."
-   Train and Validate: The model is trained k times. In each iteration, one fold is used as the validation set, and the remaining k−1 folds are used as the training set.
-   Evaluate: The model's performance is evaluated using the validation set in each iteration. Average Performance: The results from each iteration are averaged to provide a single performance metric.

We decided to use a K-fold cross-validation with 10 folds to fight overfitting. The rest remained as in our base classification tree.

### Classification Tree with Pruning

Now let's talk about the classification tree using pruning. The idea is to reduce the complexity of the tree by removing unnecessary sections. This helps a lot against overfitting but at the expense of accuracy.

In our case, we have the same components as in the base method at the beginning. Nevertheless, some parts of the process are different. In this case we are using a complexity parameter (max_depth) to control the size of the tree. We tried to play with the tuning of the hyperparameter \[5 to 30\] to check which value had the best tradeoff between accuracy and overfitting.

### Re-Sampling

Re-Sampling is a method used to address class imbalance. As it's name suppose, it creates new observations for the minority classes to match the majority classes, thus balancing the classes.

In our case, we have used a threshold in order to avoid observations with a small number of occurrences in our dataset, which would have reduced the quality of our prediction. We then used the new dataset on our "base" Classification Tree.

#### Software and Tools

-   rpart : Used for building classification and regression trees

-   pandas : Library used for data manipulation and analysis.

-   Scikit-learn: Used for data preprocessing, splitting the dataset, and calculating class weights.

-   matplotlib : Used for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations

-   seaborn : Provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics

#### Sequence of Analysis

After loading and importing our necessary functions R and Python functions, we prepared the data by first defining the make as the target variable, then encoded categorical variables using Label Encoding to convert them into dummy variables. This step is essential as Classification Tree needs numerical value to work.

We then split the dataset into a training set (80%) and a testing set (20%). This step is essential to prevent overfitting. We then tried to select the best model configuration by training the model, then assessed the final model performance on our "unseen data" of the testing set. This helps to build a robust model that generalizes well to new data.

Once the separation done, we finally trained our decision tree, using the parameters but first without tuning the hyperparameters that we talked about earlier. Then, after training the model, we have been able to use the model on the test set to compute the accuracies. This step is essential to control the performance of the model, also to control the presence of overfitting. After verification, we found overfitting after constructing the base Classification Tree model. We then decided to use the K-Fold CV to assess the performance of our "base" model.

Then we pruned the tree, by setting different max_depth value \[5 to 30\] in order to see which tradeoff between accuracy and performance (at fighting overfitting) was the best.

In addition, we decided to address class unbalances by Re-Sampling our dataset. We established a threshold of 100 observations per make to avoid including brands with insufficient data. The resulting dataset was then utilized for our “base” Classification Tree.

### Neural Network

We also used a neural network for the classification task. As already discussed, we want to predict the make of a car utilizing the other features.

A neural network is a computational model inspired by the way biological neural networks in the human brain process information. It consists of interconnected layers of nodes (neurons) where each connection has an associated weight. The network learns to map input data to the desired output by adjusting these weights through a process called training. The model can be tuned using hyperparameters set before the learning process begins that governs the overall behavior and performance of the machine learning model.

Key parameters and hyperparameters used in neural networks include:

-   **Learning Rate:** Controls how much the model’s weights are updated with respect to the gradient of the loss function.

-   **Number of Epochs:** The number of complete passes through the training dataset.

-   **Batch Size:** The number of training examples used in one iteration to update the model’s weights.

-   **Number of Layers:** Determines the depth of the network, including input, hidden, and output layers.

-   **Number of Neurons per Layer:** The size of each layer, influencing the capacity of the model to learn from data.

-   **Activation Functions:** Non-linear functions applied to the output of each neuron, such as ReLU, sigmoid, or softmax.

-   **Optimizer:** The algorithm used to update the weights, such as Adam, SGD, or RMSprop.

-   **Loss Function:** Measures the difference between the predicted and actual output, guiding the optimizer, e.g., categorical cross-entropy for classification tasks.

-   **Dropout Rate:** The fraction of neurons to drop during training to prevent overfitting.

-   **Class Weights:** Used to handle imbalanced datasets by giving more importance to underrepresented classes.

##### Preprocessing the data

An important step before training our model has been to separate numerical and categorical columns in our data preprocessing because they require different types of handling to prepare them for machine learning algorithms. The numerical columns need to be scaled by adjusting them so they have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one, which helps the machine learning algorithm perform better. While the categorical columns need to be one-hot encoded which creates a binary column a format that the machine learning model can understand.

#### Our three primary models

1.  A Simple Neural Network Model

2.  A Class-Weighted Neural Network Model

3.  And a Dropout-Enhanced Neural Network Model (also using class-weight)

All three models used the cleaned data set prepared in the data cleaning section. We chose the version with more than 10 observation for each car brands to avoid over imbalanced classes. Each model’s architecture, training process, and evaluation metrics are described in the following sections.

##### Simple Neural Network Model

The simple neural network model serves as the baseline. It consists of the following components:

-   Input Layer: Matches the number of features in the dataset.

-   Hidden Layers: Two dense layers with ReLU activation functions.

-   Output Layer: A dense layer with a softmax activation function for classification. The softmax activation function output a probability for each features input to belong to a specific class (brand). The model is trained using the Adam optimizer, categorical cross-entropy loss function, and accuracy as the primary metric.

##### Class-Weighted Neural Network Model

To address class imbalances, a class-weighted approach has then been applied. This involves assigning higher weights to the minority classes during training. The architecture of the network remains the same as the simple model. The following steps were taken:

-   Class Weights Calculation: Inverse proportionality to class frequencies.

-   Model Training: Incorporating class weights into the loss function.

The use of class weights helps in penalizing misclassification of the minority classes more heavily, thereby improving the model’s ability to predict the minority classes.

##### Dropout-Enhanced Neural Network Model

The third model incorporates dropout layers to mitigate overfitting while keeping the modification applied in our second model. Dropout layers randomly set a fraction of neurons to zero at each update during training, which helps prevent the network from becoming overly reliant on specific neurons. The deactivation of some neurons only happens during the training phases. When the model is used against the validation and test set, all neurons are active. This has the consequence of seeing higher accuracy on the validation set than the training set.

-   Model Architecture: Similar to the simple model with additional dropout layers after each dense hidden layer.

-   Dropout Rate: Will be tuned during the modeling.

The dropout-enhanced model helps improve generalization by reducing the risk of overfitting to the training data.

#### Software and Tools

The following software and tools were used to implement and evaluate the models (non-exhaustive list):

-   Python: The programming language used for all implementations.

-   TensorFlow and Keras: Libraries used for building and training neural network models.

-   Scikit-learn: Used for data preprocessing, splitting the dataset, and calculating class weights.

-   Pandas and NumPy: Libraries used for data manipulation and numerical computations.

#### Metrics

In our machine learning analysis, we used several key metrics to evaluate our model. The main metrics are the training, validation and test accuracies. The validation accuracy shows how well the model performs on the validation set, helping us tune the model during training. Training accuracy indicates the model’s performance on the training data, which helps identify overfitting. The difference between the training and validation accuracy is useful to detect the presence of overfitting in our models. The test accuracy measures the model’s performance on new, unseen data, providing an unbiased evaluation.

We also used the sensitivity to measure the model’s ability to correctly identify positive cases and the specificity that measures the ability to correctly identify negative cases. Even though, when we started to create our model, we already knew that we had unbalanced classes, these metrics confirmed this with numbers. The last metric that has been used is the Cohen’s kappa that evaluates the agreement between predicted and true labels, accounting for chance, making it more reliable than simple accuracy because it takes into account the number of classes that we want to predict. These metrics together give a comprehensive view of the model’s performance.

#### Sequence of Analysis

We first encode the categorical variables and normalized the numerical features. We then trained the models and evaluated each one. By evaluating and investigating the model at each step we managed to deal with the different challenges that we faced. We also managed to tune the dropout rate to insure to keep a good model performance while highly decreasing the case of overfitting we were having.

This sequence ensures a systematic approach to model development and evaluation, providing a clear understanding of each step involved.

## Unsupervised Learning

In order to check for some dependence between features, we decided to proceed with two unsupervised learning methods which are the Principal Component Analysis and the Clustering methods.

### Principal Component Analysis

-   Features: The features from the data_cleaned dataframe.

-   Scaling: Switching the features from categorical to factor, then factor to numerical. Then, we applied a spectral decomposition on the correlation matrix.

-   Variance proportion: We look at the proportion of variance relative to the total variance. Then we can look at the eigenvalues and check the cumulative percentage of variance that explains at least 80% of variance. Then, we obtained the number of dimensions that represent the data well.

-   Circle of correlation: The circle of correlation allows to check for the correlation between the features. Also, we can summarize into 2 dimensions.

-   Cos2: The cos2 allows to interpret the quality of the representation through the dimensions of the circle of correlation.

-   Biplot: Visualization of the observations (or individuals) within the 2 dimensions as well as the features from the circle of correlation.

-   Screeplot: Indicates the number of dimensions to select, usually it's by looking at the variance proportion (see above). It also indicates if features are correlated. The more dimensions are required, the more the features are independent.

The aim of doing a PCA is to potentially diminish the number of features as we have several features in our dataset. By doing a dimension reduction, we can only select the first few principal components.

### Clustering

Doing a clustering analysis allowed us to find some clusters that share similar characteristics measured by the features. In our case, we have decided to go with a partitioning method.

-   Partitioning Method: It begins with assigning each instance to one cluster at random, then to compute the centers and then re-assign with the closest cluster center.

-   K-means: Method for numerical data.

-   Total Within-Cluster Sum of Squares: Sum of the squared distances between each data point and its corresponding cluster centroid. It measures the compactness of the clusters. For every added cluster, the TWCSS decreases.

-   Elbow method: It is the plot to show the optimal number of clusters to select with TWCSS. At the "elbow", we have the optimal number of cluster k to select.

-   Cluster Plot: Plot to visualize the clusters.

-   Silhouette Plot: Indicates the how goodly-fitted an instance is within its cluster and also how well-separated it is from the other clusters. A good silhouette shows homogeneity within a cluster.

The clustering was aimed to provide better insights on the similarities of the instances. We started by taking the results from the PCA to add clustering in it. For a better visualization, a 3D biplot was of interest to have the overview of the clusters and the features within 3 dimensions. The final aim is to see the link between the features as well as the similarities of the observations.

#### Software and Tools

The following software and tools were used to implement and evaluate the models (non-exhaustive list):

-   R Studio: The programming language used to implement the unsupervised learning methods.

-   Factoextra: Provides tools to visualize and interpret multivariate data analyses such as the principal component analysis and clustering.

-   FactoMineR: Provides functions to visualize and interpret multivariate data analyses such as the principal component analysis and clustering.

-   Cluster: Provides methods for cluster analysis such as hierarchical clustering and partitioning methods (K-means, Partitioning Around the Medoid).
